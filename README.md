# Jujutsu UI

`jjui` is a terminal user interface for working with [Jujutsu version control system](https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj). I have built it according to my own needs and will keep adding new features as I need them. I am open to feature requests and contributions.

If you are new `jjui`, have a look at [previously on jjui](https://github.com/idursun/jjui/discussions/443).

## Features

### Change revset with auto-complete
You can change revset while enjoying auto-complete and signature help while typing.

### Rebase
You can rebase a revision or a branch onto another revision in the revision tree.

See [Rebase](https://idursun.github.io/jjui/revisions/rebase/) for detailed information.

### Squash
You can squash revisions into one revision, by pressing `S`. The following revision will be automatically selected. However, you can change the selection using `j` and `k`.

### Show revision details

Pressing `l` (as in going right into the details of a revision) will open the details view of the revision you selected.

In this mode, you can:
- Restore selected files using `r` (press `i` in the dialog for interactive chunk restore)
- Split selected files using `s`
- View diffs of the highlighted by pressing `d`

For detailed information, see [Details](https://idursun.github.io/jjui/details/) page.

### Bookmarks
You can move bookmarks to the revision you selected.

### Op Log
You can switch to op log view by pressing `o`. Pressing `r` restores the selected operation. For more information, see [Op log](https://idursun.github.io/jjui/oplog/) page.

### Preview
You can open the preview window by pressing `p`. If the selected item is a revision, then the output of `jj show` command is displayed. Similarly, `jj diff` output is displayed for selected files,  and `jj op show` output is displayed for selected operations.

While the preview window is showing, you can press; `ctrl+n` to scroll one line down, `ctrl+p` to scroll one line up, `ctrl+d` to scroll half a page down, `ctrl+u` to scroll half a page up.

Additionally, you can press `d` to show the contents of preview in diff view.

Preview commands run with a `[preview.env]` table you can extend in your config; by default jjui sets `DFT_WIDTH` so [difftastic](https://difftastic.wilfred.me.uk/) reflows to the preview pane width.

For detailed information, see [Preview](https://idursun.github.io/jjui/preview/) page.
